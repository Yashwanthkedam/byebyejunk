## 🛠️ How to Install (No Chrome Web Store Needed)

Yep, Google charges $5 to put stuff on the Web Store.  
But we don’t want your money — or your data.  
So here’s the **easy peasy way** to install it yourself.

### 🧩 Step-by-Step:

1. **Download or Clone this repo**  
   Click the green button ↑ that says `Code` and hit **Download ZIP**.

2. **Unzip it**  
   You’ll get a folder called something like `BYE-BYE-JUNK-main`.

3. **Open Chrome and go to:**  
   `chrome://extensions`

4. **Turn on Developer Mode** (top right corner)

5. **Click "Load unpacked"**  
   Choose the folder you just unzipped.

6. 🎉 Boom! You’ll now see the "BYE BYE JUNK" icon near your Chrome toolbar.

## 🧪 How to Use It

1. Click the 💌 icon in your toolbar.
2. Click **"Scan for Junk"**.
3. See what garbage is lurking in your inbox.
4. Click **Unsubscribe** and walk away like a hero.

## 🙋‍♀️ FAQs

**Q: Does this read my emails?**  
A: Nope! It only checks for "List-Unsubscribe" headers in promotional emails. All on your device. Private & safe.

**Q: Will it delete stuff on its own?**  
A: Not without your say-so. You're the boss.

**Q: Why isn't it on the Chrome Web Store?**  
A: Because we’d have to pay $5. And who needs that when this works just fine for free?
